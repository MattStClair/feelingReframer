      <h3> Project background </h3>

      <p> With my background as a mental health therapist, it was my goal to build an application that I thought
      of prior to beginning as a developer.</p> <p> The feeling reframer's idea is based on concepts borrowed from a psychological therapy
      approach known as Narrative Therapy. Narrative therapy is based on the post modern principle that our reality is created by
      the words we use to describe it. </p> <p> As a therapist, I find work with people who come in with a limited emotional vocabulary, which
      making it difficlu to express theirselves accurately. Thus, it is important to be able to have synonyms to express accurately
      what is truly being felt. </p>

  <p>
Hello, my name is Matt St.Clair. I am an Air Force veteran and a mental health therapist, transitioning into the web development field. I am finishing a B.S. in computer applications development from Renton Technical College while also taking full stack web development courses at Codefellows code camp in Seattle. I enjoy front end as well as back end work but am especially fascinated with UX design and how it blends with my social sciences background. I also enjoy front-end work because it allows me to collaborate and create with clients. </p>

      <div>
         <h3 id = "bioTitle">Technical Experience</h4>
        <p>At codefellows, I have created web apps in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in Atom using Chrome developer tools, and often working in groups, utilizing issues in GitHub and agile project workflow. At Renton Technical College, I work in Android and Visual Studios using object oriented programming as well as in multiple data base platforms to include MS Access, Excel, and Tableau. I am also the web content manager at Renton Area Youth and Family Services on their Wordpress site.
